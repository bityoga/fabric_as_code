General:

    # Ledger Type: The ledger type to provide to the orderer.
    # Two non-production ledger types are provided for test purposes only:
    #  - ram: An in-memory ledger whose contents are lost on restart.
    #  - json: A simple file ledger that writes blocks to disk in JSON format.
    # Only one production ledger type is provided:
    #  - file: A production file-based ledger.
    LedgerType: file

    # Listen address: The IP on which to bind to listen.
    ListenAddress: 127.0.0.1

    # Listen port: The port on which to bind to listen.
    ListenPort: 7050

    # TLS: TLS settings for the GRPC server.
    TLS:
        Enabled: true

        # disconnect them.
        ServerMinInterval: 60s
        # ServerInterval is the time between pings to clients.
        ServerInterval: 7200s

    # such as Raft based ordering service.
    Cluster:

        # The below 4 properties should be either set together, or be unset together.
        # If they are set, then the orderer node uses a separate listener for intra-cluster
        # communication. If they are unset, then the general orderer listener is used.
        # This is useful if you want to use a different TLS server certificates on the
        # client-facing and the intra-cluster listeners.

        # ListenPort defines the port on which the cluster listens to connections.

    # Genesis method: The method by which the genesis block for the orderer
    # system channel is specified. Available options are "provisional", "file":

    #  - file: Uses the file provided by GenesisFile as the genesis block.
